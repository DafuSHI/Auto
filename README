kubernetes     overlay network




Pre-request:
Docker daemon 1.10.1 or Docker daemon 1.9.1

Step0:

In file inventory, right down the ip address of your machine. You must set no password logging for all the machine for the ansible machine


Step 1:

./proxy.sh

This is for setting the proxy for the machines


Step 2:

./networking.sh

This is for setting the right netwoking for kubernetes. As docker only works in one machine,we must configure them to appear in the same overlay network. Here we use OVS


Step 3:

./kubernetes.sh

Run it and let it do the rest
